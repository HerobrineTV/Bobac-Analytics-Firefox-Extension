# Bobac-Analytics-Firefox-Extension

Code for the Bobac Analytics Firefox Extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/rbx-analytics/

This is the first ever Browser Extension I made, in the code u can kinda see this.
Also back then I made it in Manifest 2 and wasnt able to update it.
This Extension will most likely never get a update again since the Use of it died in the past year.
Roblox made some pretty bad decissions which ruined traiding and the Items which can be traded.
